# Calendar-Application

## Description

This web application is a calendar application. It displays the current date at the top of the page, and lets the user plan out various business hours in their day from 9-5. Users can insert text into each hour from 9-5 in order to keep track of everything they need to do. This data gets saved so that even when the page gets refreshed, the users data remains saved. The time blocks also change color depending on what time it is. If the hour segment is in the past, its grey. If the hour segment is the current hour, then it will be red. If the hour segment is later in the day, then that segment will be green.

Throughout the project I worked with various functions and methods in order to achieve proper navigation and functionality. I also used JQuerry in order to streamline my script.js file. I worked in html and js in order to complete this application. Starting code was provided by my bootcamp.

## Instalation

This entire project was made in Visual Studio. We were provided starter code for the application from the UCSD Extended Studies Coding Bootcamp, which I built upon as I finished the application. 

## Usage

The final product looks like this:

You can see the date is being displayed on the top of the page. If the user wishes to add something to their day planner, they can simply type what they want in the time slot and press the save button. This will save the user input into localstorage where they will remain even if the page is refreshed. 

Here is a link to the completed web application:
